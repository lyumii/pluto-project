          Pluto, once celebrated as the ninth planet of our solar system,
          continues to captivate our imagination despite its reclassification as
          a dwarf planet. Located in the distant Kuiper Belt, this icy world is
          a realm of mystery and wonder, characterized by its unique surface
          features and fascinating geological activity. Adding to its intrigue
          is its system of five moons—Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and
          Hydra—which orbit in a dance as unique as Pluto itself. Together, they
          form a celestial family that has reshaped our understanding of the
          outer reaches of the solar system.

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell
                Observatory in Arizona. For 76 years, it was celebrated as the
                ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the
                International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a
                “dwarf planet” after defining what constitutes a planet. This
                sparked debates and nostalgia among the public, as Pluto held a
                special place in many hearts. Despite its reclassification,
                Pluto remains a fascinating celestial body due to its unique
                characteristics and the mysteries it holds.

              <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Pluto is smaller than Earth's Moon, with a diameter of only
                  about 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A day on Pluto (one rotation) takes about 6.4 Earth days, and
                  it takes 248 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Its surface is covered in nitrogen ice, and it has mountains
                  made of water ice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pluto's heart-shaped glacier, called Tombaugh Regio, is one of
                  its most famous features.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.
            Charon, the largest, was discovered in 1978 by James Christy and
            stands out because it’s so big compared to Pluto that the two are
            often considered a double dwarf planet system. The other four moons
            were discovered between 2005 and 2012 using the Hubble Space
            Telescope. These moons were named after figures from Greek mythology
            associated with the underworld, matching Pluto's namesake.

            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Charon is half the size of Pluto, and the two are tidally
                locked, meaning they always show the same face to each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                Nix and Hydra's surfaces are unusually bright, suggesting
                they're made mostly of water ice.
              </li>
              <li>
                The New Horizons mission in 2015 provided the first detailed
                images of Pluto's moons, revolutionizing our understanding of
                this distant system.
